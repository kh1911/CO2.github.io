# Embodied Emissions IOA

This repository contains Matlab codes used for research "The flow of embodied carbon through the economies of China, the European Union, and the United States."
Feel free to clone them for your research purpose.

Here is the detail of the directory for code used in this project:
17 Sector Resolution (Matlab code used to obtain CO2 emissions in 17 sector resolution)
  (Data downloaded from China Environmentally Extended Input Output database for result verification purpose in year 2007)
  CEEIO Data 
  (Data downloaded from EXIOBASE database for result verification purpose in year 2007)
  EXIO Data 
  (Matlab Codes used to compare result obtained from two databases, display result in 17 sector resolution, and aggregation operation)

Three other folders and .mat files are not hosted in this repository due to oversizing issue:

- 200\_item\_embodied\_emission (folder)
- 200\_item\_direct\_emission (folder)
- E\_dir\_17x49.mat
